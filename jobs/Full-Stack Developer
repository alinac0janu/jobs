# Overview

Because 3D printing is a rapidly evolving industry, we find ourselves learning and educating at the same time, this means iterations have to be fast-paced. You'll be able to rapidly A/B test different solutions with our customers and suppliers, helping you to find the ones that works best.

You will help craft features that are groundbreaking and accelerating the entire Additive Manufacturing industry. But most of all, you will be building a unique experience for engineers, designers and architects that use 3D printing to prototype their next big idea. Don't be surprised when you get hit by goosebumps when engineers from NASA, Tesla or DARPA give you kudos on your latest features, helping them to be more productive and prototype even faster.

Our challenges are threefold; e-commerce, a market place and 3D printing. These combined allow you to apply your skills in a complex environment and solve meaningful customer problems daily.
